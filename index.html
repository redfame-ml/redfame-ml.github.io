			<p>Hello! I am Clayton.</p>
			<p>On this website, you can play some games and look at a variety of projects which I have worked on, and even some of those that are incomplete as of the moment. You can also look at drawings, same applies there.</p>
			<p>I am a big fan of the game <a>Five Nights At Freddy's</a>, enjoy the movie <a>I.T. (2017)</a>, and more.</p>
			<p><i>Note: this website is under construction, but not dead yet!</i></p>

			<p>This is a drawing of Chica (spanish for 'girl') walking towards the office (represented by the empty door), with a puppet in the background. Look at Five Nights At Freddies (One).</p>
			<p>...oh yeah, there is an addictive snake clone in the <a href='games'>games</a> tab (and lazy John will soon make the other games, just believe)!</p>
